//! Fetch v2, level 1 — readable-text fetch for Auxesis.
//!
//! This crate replaces the 22k-line HTML/CSS hidden-content model that used
//! to live in `kernel-broker`. It has two levels:
//!
//! - **Simple path** (`Fetcher::fetch` with [`RenderMode::Simple`]):
//!   `reqwest` + html5ever + a minimal readability-style main-content
//!   extractor, bounded by the SSRF guard, redirect cap, body cap, parse cap
//!   and output cap.
//! - **Browser path** ([`RenderMode::Browser`]): delegated to a
//!   [`BrowserFetcher`]. Until WS-B installs headless Chromium, the default
//!   implementation is [`UnavailableBrowser`], which returns the typed
//!   [`FetchError::BrowserUnavailable`].
//!
//! # This is not a hidden-content boundary
//!
//! The simple path does **not** model CSS visibility. `display:none`,
//! `visibility:hidden`, `font-size:0`, off-screen positioning, clipped
//! containers and every other paint-level hiding rule are invisible to it:
//! text hidden that way can still appear in the output. Hidden-content
//! findings are **KNOWN-ACCEPTED ("not a boundary")**.
//!
//! Consumers for which visibility is a security property (anything that
//! makes decisions on "the user can see this") must use the browser path,
//! where Chromium's `innerText` is the only correct oracle. The SSRF guard,
//! redirect re-checks and size/time caps **do** remain a boundary and are
//! enforced on every request.
