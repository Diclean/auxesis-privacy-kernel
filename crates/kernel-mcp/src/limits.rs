//! Hard bounds and per-operation budgets for one MCP server connection.
//!
//! Every value here is a *default*: a call site (a test, or a per-server
//! config) may override any of them. The frame reader stops as soon as the
//! configured bound is crossed and returns [`McpError::FrameTooLarge`] — it
//! never hands back a partial frame for the caller to mis-parse.
//!
//! # What `read_frame` can and cannot prove
//!
//! [`read_frame`] reads until the reader reports EOF. It **cannot** tell a
//! complete body from a truncated-but-valid prefix: knowing whether a
//! `Content-Length` was satisfied or an SSE stream delivered its terminal
//! event is the transport's job, not this crate's. Truncation
//! detection therefore lives in the transport; `read_frame` alone never proves
//! completeness.
//!
//! # `FrameTooLarge` is terminal for the connection
//!
//! When [`read_frame`] returns [`McpError::FrameTooLarge`], the reader has
//! stopped at an unknown offset (a body has no resync point). The connection **must be dropped and never resumed**;
//! resuming would parse the tail of an oversized frame as if it were a fresh
//! message. [`McpError::requires_connection_close`] encodes that rule.
//!
//! An I/O failure is reported as [`McpError::Io`], which carries only the
//! [`std::io::ErrorKind`] — never the raw `io::Error` string, which can embed
//! filesystem paths or secrets.
