//! Tools and the permission broker for Auxesis.
//!
//! The tool interface and the approval contract are documented with the app
//! that uses this crate, not here.
//!
//! - [`Tool`] is the single interface every tool implements. Tools are
//!   registered in a [`ToolRegistry`] so the chat loop can look them up by
//!   name and hand their [`Tool::schema`] to the model.
//! - [`Broker`] decides whether a call may run: ordered `allow`/`ask`/`deny`
//!   rules per agent, last match wins (defaults first). `ask` consults an [`Approver`] callback,
//!   and **every** decision is audited to the store as a `tool.decision`
//!   event.
//!
//! v1 is intentionally not fully sandboxed: `shell` really runs a shell. The
//! broker and its audit trail are the wall for `shell`; file tools are
//! confined to the agent workspace, and text helpers strip invisible characters
//! from external content.
#![doc = include_str!("../README.md")]

// `test-util` widens this crate's constructors for dependents' tests (for
// example `ShellSandbox::with_test_sandbox_exec`). A release build that turns
// it on would ship a test seam, so it is a hard error there: only a debug
// (test) profile may enable it, and only through a `[dev-dependencies]` edge.
