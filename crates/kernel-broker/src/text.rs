/// in a row: every caller (API previews, error details, the WS frame
/// sanitizer, the run-summary scrub and the daemon log writer) gets all of
/// them without knowing about them.
///
/// - **L-1 known values.** Exact-value redaction of the secrets this process
///   has resolved (`AUX_KEY_*` from `.env`/environment, the API token, every
///   provider key the engine loads), plus their common transforms
///   (base64, percent-encoded, JSON-escaped, whitespace/zero-width-split).
///   `crate::scrub` owns the registry; the scan is linear and off — zero
///   allocation — when nothing is registered. This is the layer that catches
///   a key with no name in front of it; the shape layers remain the fallback
///   for unknown secrets.
/// - **L0 normalise.** Secret-adjacent separator lookalikes (`＝`, `：` and
///   the small forms) are folded to their ASCII separators, and every
///   control/invisible/format character (U+200B–U+200F, U+2060, U+FEFF,
///   soft hyphen, bidi controls, …) is stripped. `token\u{200b}=…`,
///   `api_key＝…` and `api_key：…` are therefore the same pair as their ASCII
///   spelling *before* any scan runs (B3-03, B3-04). The fold is
///   context-sensitive: only a lookalike separator directly after a
///   credential-looking name is rewritten, so ordinary prose, curly quotes,
///   CJK punctuation and fullwidth letters come out byte-identical
///   (B5-07/H-05).
/// - **L1 structured.** When the text — or a balanced JSON substring inside
///   it — parses with `serde_json`, the value tree is walked: the value of
///   any key whose normalised name names a credential is replaced, values
///   that are themselves JSON strings are scrubbed recursively, and the
///   region is re-serialised. Pretty-printed JSON, escaped quotes, nesting
///   and JSON-inside-JSON cannot hide a key from a parser (B3-01, B3-02).
///   [`scrub_json_value`] exposes the same walk to callers that hold a
///   `serde_json::Value` *before* it is re-serialised (activity/WS summaries).
///   A region with nothing to redact is returned **byte for byte** (B4-01):
///   whitespace, escape spelling, duplicate keys, key order and every number
///   lexeme survive untouched. Only a region in which something *was*
///   redacted is re-serialised (compactly, keys in input order via
///   `preserve_order`, numbers exact via `arbitrary_precision`).
/// - **L2 tokenizer.** The single-pass, linear-time tokenizer from round 2,
///   extended with multi-line pair values (bounded window), `\"` escapes,
///   `;`-separated cookie jars, percent-encoded URL schemes and the stricter
///   `plausible_token` gates.
///
/// The layer order matters: normalising first means L1 can parse JSON that
/// carries invisible or fullwidth punctuation, and the parser runs before
/// the tokenizer so escapes (`{\"api_key\":…}`) are resolved on real keys.
///
/// The tokenizer recognises, in any position:
///
/// - PEM blocks (`-----BEGIN <label>-----`, label case-insensitive) whose
///   label contains `PRIVATE KEY`, through the matching `-----END` marker (or
///   to the end of the text when it is missing), and PuTTY/OpenSSH new-format
///   keys (`PuTTY-User-Key-File-…`, no `BEGIN` marker);
/// - URL/URI userinfo credentials (`scheme://user:pass@host`, any scheme,
///   `redis://:pass@`, `mongodb+srv://…`, and the percent-encoded
///   `scheme%3A%2F%2Fuser:pass@host` spelling): the credential part is
///   replaced, the scheme and host stay readable;
/// - HTTP header lines: `authorization`/`proxy-authorization` values that
///   look like opaque secrets, and the whole value of `cookie`, `set-cookie`,
///   `x-api-key`, `x-auth-token`, `x-hub-signature*`, `x-amz-security-token`,
///   `x-goog-api-key` and `x-access-token` — short, low-entropy cookie values
///   included;
/// - key/value pairs separated by `=`, `:`, `:=` or their percent-encoded
///   forms `%3D`/`%3A`, quoted (`{"api_key":"…"}`, `"k": "v"`) or unquoted,
///   with an optional line break and indentation between the separator and
///   the value, with vendor-style names split on `_`/`-`/`.` (`DB_PASSWORD`,
///   `client_secret`, `GPG_PASSPHRASE`, `X-Api-Key`, …), the daemon's own
///   `AUX_KEY_…` env shape, cookie-jar names (`session`, `sid`, `jsessionid`,
///   `csrftoken`, …) and URL-shaped names (`*_URL`, `*_URI`,
///   `*_WEBHOOK_URL`);
/// - vendor-prefixed tokens (`sk-`, `ghp_`, `github_pat_`, `glpat-`, `AIza`,
///   `AKIA…`, `xox…-`, `npm_`, …), matched only at the start of a token run so
///   `task-sk-1234` and `disk-sk-usage` stay readable;
/// - `Bearer`/`Basic` scheme values and `curl -u`/`--user`/`--password`
///   values that look like opaque credentials;
/// - `eyJ…` JWTs (three dot-separated segments).
///
/// Value shape gates keep ordinary text intact: a secret-named assignment is
/// redacted when its value is token-shaped (digits, mixed case, a long opaque
/// run or a quoted passphrase) — so `public_key_sha256 = 9f2a1b3c`,
/// `key = "abcdefghijkl"` and `let token = parse(input);` survive — and the
/// strongest components (`password`, `token`, `secret`, …) use a looser gate
/// than the weak `key` component. Hash/checksum/fingerprint names without a
/// strong component (`public_key_sha256`) are never treated as credentials, a
/// `*_id`/`*_uuid` name is an identifier, and an all-digit epoch, a UUID or a
/// CamelCase type name is not a secret by shape alone (B3-07). A match is
/// re-emitted with its original spelling, never rewritten to a constant name.
///

/// newline-encoded before they reach the text are out of scope, and no
/// caller may claim more than that. The API response body is the contract.
///
/// B4-01: a text with nothing to redact is returned **byte for byte**
